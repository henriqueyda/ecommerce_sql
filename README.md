# Brazilian E-Commerce Kaggle Dataset.

In this project I wrote several T-SQL queries to build a relational database based on .csv files from [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Kaggle Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). The aim of this project is to practice my skills in SQL and my knowledge regarding relational databases. The database diagram is the following:

The file advanced_queries.sql contains queries to explore some features in dataset and bring some useful information.
